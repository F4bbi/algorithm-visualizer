# Algorithm Visualizer
This is the source code of https://visual-go.netlify.app, my work-in-progress project for algorithm visualization made using Godot game engine with GDScript. This project provides a collection of interactive visualizations for various algorithms, making it easier to understand their inner workings. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or use these visualizations in your educational materials.
